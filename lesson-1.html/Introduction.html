      // we have a new element <a> called anchor element. It is basically a link to another website. href is an attribute where we can give the link of any website and the attribute value must be surrounded by double quotes. To add another attribute, add a space and give the name (here: target). Target attribute determines whether the link opens in current page or in a new tab. To open in new tab, type _blank.

      // Extra spaces are ignored in HTML. Example: paragraph      of text is same as paragraph of text. Also the new lines are also ignored when we enter a new line for the HTML tags. This makes the code more flexible. The spaces for each line are called indents and it takes two sapces for an indent.
